  # Bingo Scanner Privacy Policy
  Last updated: 8 November 2025

  Bingo Scanner (“the App”) is operated by Xin Wei Teoh (“we”,
  “us”). This policy explains what information we collect, how we
  use it, and the choices available to you.

  ## 1. Information We Collect
  ### 1.1 Camera & Images
  - Live camera feed and captured card photos are processed on-
  device solely to scan bingo cards.
  - Images are not transmitted to our servers or to ad/analytics
  partners unless you explicitly choose to share them.

  ### 1.2 Device & Usage Data
  - Device model, OS version, language, time zone, and app
  version.
  - In-app events (screen views, button taps, error logs) needed
  to keep the app reliable.

  ### 1.3 Advertising & Analytics Identifiers
  - Google Advertising ID / IDFA and similar identifiers.
  - IP-derived coarse location (city/region) for regional
  compliance and ad targeting.

  ### 1.4 Purchases & Entitlements
  - Receipts or transaction IDs for premium upgrades (stored
  locally and in Apple/Google systems).
  - We do not collect or store payment card numbers.

  ### 1.5 Crash & Performance Data
  - Anonymous crash traces and performance metrics via Sentry/
  Expo.

  ## 2. How We Use Information
  - Provide core features such as bingo-card scanning, number
  tracking, and win detection.
  - Maintain premium entitlements and restore purchases.
  - Analyze aggregate usage to improve usability and performance.
  - Show ads to free-tier users through Google AdMob and respect
  frequency caps.
  - Detect and prevent fraud, abuse, or violations of our terms.

  ## 3. Sharing & Third Parties
  We do not sell personal information. We share limited data
  with:
  - **Google AdMob & Google User Messaging Platform (UMP):**
  serves ads, records consent choices, and enforces personalized/
  non-personalized settings.
  - **Google Analytics for Firebase / Expo analytics:** app usage
  stats and diagnostics.
  - **Expo / EAS Services:** builds and OTA updates.
  - **Apple & Google in-app purchases:** transaction validation.
  Each provider processes data under its own privacy policy
  and is contractually bound to use it only to provide their
  services.

  ## 4. Data Storage & Retention
  - Camera data stays local and is discarded after bingo numbers
  are extracted.
  - Usage analytics are stored for up to 24 months for trend
  analysis.
  - Purchase history is retained as required by Apple/Google and
  applicable tax laws.
  - Crash logs are retained for 90 days unless legal obligations
  require longer.

  ## 5. Children’s Privacy
  Bingo Scanner is designed for general audiences but may be used
  by seniors with caregivers. We do not knowingly collect data
  from children under 13 (or under the minimum age required in
  your region). If you believe we’ve collected data from a child,
  contact us to remove it.

  ## 6. Your Choices
  - **Ads & Consent:** Use the in-app consent dialog (EU/EEA & CA
  residents) to choose personalized or non-personalized ads, or
  withdraw consent.
  - **Device Permissions:** You can revoke camera access in OS
  settings, though core scanning features will stop working.
  - **Limit Ad Tracking:** Use system settings (iOS “Allow
  Apps to Request to Track”, Android “Reset advertising ID”) to
  restrict identifiers.

  ## 7. Security
  We employ industry-standard safeguards (encryption in transit,
  secure key storage, least-privilege access) to protect your
  information. No system is 100% secure; please report any
  suspected vulnerabilities.

  ## 8. International Transfers
  Data may be processed on servers located in the United States
  or other countries. We rely on standard contractual clauses and
  similar safeguards where applicable.

  ## 9. Updates to This Policy
  We may update this policy to reflect app changes or legal
  requirements. “Last updated” will indicate the latest revision.
  Significant changes will be announced in-app or by email when
  available.
